    <h1>Some facts of the Dog</h1>

<div class="container">
    <p>
      <i>
        <span class="fletter">P</span>ets give people so much in terms of love and emotional support. Simply stroking a dog, cat, rabbit or even horse can lead to lower blood pressure and can combat stress. The feelings are reciprocated, as our touch can have therapeutic effects for our pets, particularly if they are feeling out of sorts.
  Companion animals can provide support and friendship to societyâ€™s lonely, sick or elderly. They can be friends to those who do not easily understand the world around them. Autistic children for instance can be guided gently from their closed,
   confusing and isolated worlds by a patient and loving dog or cat.
    Anxiety disorders and depression also can be eased by the loving presence of a pet.

    Different dog breeds have different lifespans. In general, smaller dogs live longer than bigger ones. The size and the breed of the dog change how long the dog lives, on average. Breeds such as the Dachshund usually live for fifteen years, Chihuahuas can reach age twenty. The Great Dane, on the other hand has an average lifespan of six to eight years; some Great Danes have lived for ten years..

<h2>Why Pets are called as Humans BestFriends</h2>
<p><i>
Dogs are often called "man's best friend" because they fit in with human life. Man refers to humankind and not just guys. Dogs can serve people in many ways. For example, there are guard dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, guide dogs for blind people, and police dogs. There are also dogs that are trained to smell for diseases in the human body or to find bombs or illegal drugs. These dogs sometimes help police in airports or other areas. Sniffer dogs (usually beagles) are sometimes trained for this job. Dogs have even been sent by Russians into outer space, a few years before any human being. The first dog sent up was named Laika, but she died within a few hours.
